do experimental feature:
code splitting for pd and ld, so that if they both reference for example components/Link, it's loadHooks don't get added twice per the same page.
you could do this for *all* of the pds and lds *after* everything else is built.

all code in pages being transpiled into DIST_DIR might be a bad idea,
users could not be aware of this, and leak sensitive code.

we could instead move them to .elegance/transpiled,
and have things like layout_data, etc, things we actually *want* to share, in the DIST_DIR
